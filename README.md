## Login Page HTML Documentation

### Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of a basic login page created using HTML and Bootstrap. The login page allows users to enter their email and password to access a secured system. Additionally, there is a "Forgot Password?" link for password recovery.

### 1. Overview

The login page is designed to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for user authentication. It adheres to a responsive design using Bootstrap for styling, ensuring a consistent look and feel across devices.

### 2. HTML Structure

The HTML structure consists of several key components:

- **`<head>` Section**: This section contains metadata and external links to Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript.

- **`<body>` Section**: The main body of the HTML page contains the login form and associated elements.

  - **`.container`**: A Bootstrap container class is used to center-align the form and provide padding.

  - **`<form>` Element**: The form includes two input fields: one for "Email ID" (`<input type="text">`) and another for "Password" (`<input type="password">`). The form also has a "Login" button and a "Forgot Password?" link.

### 3. Styles

The page's styling is defined in the `<style>` section within the `<head>` of the HTML document. Notable style features include:

- **Background**: The background color of the page is set to black, providing a visually appealing contrast with white text.

- **Container Styling**: The login form is placed within a container with a maximum width of 400px. It has a semi-transparent background to maintain visibility of the background color.

### 4. Form Elements

- **Email and Password Inputs**: Users are required to enter their email and password. The fields are labeled "Email ID" and "Password" respectively.

- **Login Button**: A "Login" button allows users to submit their login information for authentication.

- **Forgot Password Link**: A "Forgot Password?" link redirects users to a password recovery page (not provided in this documentation).

### 5. Usage

To use this login page:

1. Copy the HTML code into a new file and save it with an `.html` extension (e.g., `login.html`).

2. Customize the page as needed, including adding functionality for server-side authentication and password recovery.

3. Ensure that Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript dependencies are correctly linked in the `<head>` section.

4. Host the HTML file on a web server or web hosting platform to make it accessible to users.

Users can access the login page by navigating to the URL where the HTML file is hosted. They can then enter their email and password to log in or click the "Forgot Password?" link for password recovery.
